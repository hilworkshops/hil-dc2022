** Aims of the Workshop **

With the growing amount of people living in ever denser areas, there is an increasing demand for novel Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support the complex social and environmental interactions of citizens, and to improve their quality of life. A typical example is the concept and construct of the ''smart city'', which has been introduced to highlight the importance of ICT for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. 

This workshop focuses on citizens' recommender systems. This particular type of recommender systems, while still belonging to the broad area of recommendation, differs from conventional recommender systems both in terms of ownership and purpose. Unlike conventional recommender systems driven by a per-click business model, citizens' recommender systems are run by citizen themselves and serve the society as a whole. By soliciting behavioural data from citizens, the systems can make recommendations to optimally improve the living experiences of citizens in a society. 

Such behavioural data used to be scarce, hindering the development of citizens' recommender systems. The emergence of social data, i.e. data generated by people during their activities in a social environment, available through new sources (e.g. social media, mobile phones, sensor networks), brings great opportunities for studying the usefulness of aggregated citizen behaviours. Social data contain important signals on citizen-environment and citizen-citizen interactions. By exploiting such data, recommender systems have the potential to play an important role in improving citizen satisfaction in multiple societal contexts, and to mitigate the information overload problem in societal decision making processes. 

** Theme and Topics **

Recommender systems have been playing a central role in a variety of domains. When restricted to the application for citizens, a large body of literature could be found on Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation, tourist location recommendation, and orthogonally, spatio-temporal context-aware recommendation. However, existing literature primarily focuses on a single domain (e.g. POI recommendation) from an algorithmic perspective, without considering from a personal perspective the closely related citizen activities as a continuous experience. Citizen activities in daily life, including transportation, working, sports, entertainment, shopping, etc., while being diverse, are closely related to each other. Together they describe a continuous experience for a citizen living in an urban environment. This calls for scientific investigation on the relationships among citizens' daily activities, in order to better understand their behaviors. 

More importantly, the target user of conventional recommender systems are individuals, while citizens' recommender systems serve the society as a whole. To optimise the effectiveness of recommendations to the society, citizens' recommender systems require deep understanding of citizen-environment and citizen-citizen interactions. For example, to optimally recommend driving routes to a community of citizens, the system should be able to understand how the effectiveness of recommendations is influenced by the environment (e.g. road condition) and how the recommendations to different citizens affect each other (e.g. to avoid traffic congestion). The latter example shows the need for either algorithmic design for the recommendations to benefit the society as a whole, or incentive mechanisms to balance personal and societal interests. 

The success of citizens' recommender systems heavily depends on the amount and quality of citizens' behavioural data, which were used to be scarce. The scarcity, on the one hand, can be compensated by engaging citizens to actively contribute their behavioural data to the system, i.e. citizen crowdsourcing via effective incentive schemes. On the other hand, the emergence of social data, i.e. data generated by people during their societal activities, available through new sources (e.g. social media, mobile phones, sensor networks), brings both opportunities and challenges to the development of citizens' recommender systems. Such data, when well-integrated, contain a multitude of dimensions, such as the targeted urban population, the purpose of use, the spatio-temporal context, etc.. Thus they describe comprehensively citizens' behaviors and their relationships with the environment, providing opportunities for recommendation based techniques to enhance citizens' living experiences. At the same time, social data are characterized by an intrinsic diversity, manifested through each of the relevant dimensions. It remains an open question how to leverage such diversity for optimally enhancing citizens' living experiences. 

Recent studies have shown that recommender systems can actively change citizen mobility patterns, reducing traffic congestion and improve urban mobility. By exploiting social data and addressing the challenges, recommender systems have the potential to largely expand their impact and play an important role in today's society, in improving citizens' living experiences and the effectiveness of environmental use.
