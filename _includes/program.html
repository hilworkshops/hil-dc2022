<h4>Keynote</h4>
by <b>Daniel Gatica-Perez</b>, Idiap-EPFL <br/>
<br/>

<b>Civic Media, Crowdsourcing, and the Public Good</b>

<p>The engagement of young people in local civic concerns
has educational, social, and economic implications.
There is an entire open agenda of civic issues that
research can support, spanning rich data collection,
data analysis, and media creation and repurposing.<br />

I will present experiences with mobile crowdsourcing
frameworks where young people can make visible a number
of urban issues that matter to them. Integrating mobile
surveys, photos and video, content analysis, and media
creation, the goal is to enable reflection processes
through which discussions to rethink urban issues can
emerge. This will be illustrated with examples in
Latin America and Switzerland. I will argue for the
need to think beyond single disciplines, and motivate
the audience to seize the opportunities that emerge
from working with communities, both to contribute to
the public good and to advance socio-technical approaches
involving citizens and cities.</p>
